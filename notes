system requirements for my app

mention research on other apps i have done and mention their achivements and fails eg. user satisfaction, functionality, design, and market reception
show the ui of the app and mention its pros and cons. usability, aesthetics, and user experience
key features of my app which will set it away from the competitors

taskA(ii) 24

A detailed proposal of how they will meet the scenario 
Reasoned justifications of why they have chosen that solution

meet needs of incoming and existing customers

functional requirements - behavior of the system in a specific task of function eg: user registration, avalibity checking
non functional requirements - qualties or characteristics of the system eg: security, accessibility, usability, sacleabilty, maintainabilty 

^ --------------------------------------------
  | Id | Features | Priority | Justification |

business context
  stakeholders: users (usability), staff (usage), owners (maxing capital), developers, government (taxes, licencing)

decomposition to solving the functional and non functional requirements

kpi - a target to aim for to measure success (metrics) in the system typically after deployment
error rate
uptime
increase in popularity
security
relability
scalability

empathy map

- thinks
  eg i forgot my password
- says
  eg how do i reset my password
- does
  eg nativagtes to website login page and press "i forgot my password"

proposal
mention the tools used windows forms, sql
user interface (consitant layout)

user accetpance
sections of the system eg: layout, dashboard, booking tickets/rooms
- what the user can see and do on the page
eg use the navigation bar
   viewing avaliable movies and room a seat for a movie

as a <role>     i want to <goal>          so that<benefit>           acceptance criteria
eg customer     eg book movie tickets     eg i can watch a movie     go to home page -> search for movie -> book tickets

justification
how the solution meets the client requirements (consitant layout (navbar, footer etc), login system (forgot password, security), dashboard)
how potential risks will be reduced
aql security how it applies to the gdpr and w3c (accessability)

gdpr: 
purpose limitation
lawful (user accepting tos. gathering information with their permission)
minimalisation only keeping nesaassery data
accracy verificarion 

w3c:
perceivable text sizes, tts, color distingishes
operable no photo shensitive content
undersand (10-20 seconds is important) font sizes 12-16 suitable colour contrast
    websites gives them information when they do wrong inputs

task2

## navigation map - eg:
box with header of page and a short description of what its use is
eg: home login "Main page of the site which contains the navbar and links to other parts of the site
    and main information of the site to give the user a understanding of their service"

        Home Page
       \/            \/
Registration Page      Non member page
       \/
  Buy Premium

color topography/theory

flowcharts/psudo code for different algorithms that will be used
eg: logging in, registering, booking room etc
    validating password (security checks, length, symbol, cap)

## data requirements:
database tables that could be would be used in development
dataflow chart eg:
    
    ??? <- user -> payment subscription
        \/
          movie tickets

## approch to testing
white box testing
    - testing internal structures
    - access to the source code
    - can be automated

black box testing
    - no access to code
    - inputs/outputs
    - more realisitic
